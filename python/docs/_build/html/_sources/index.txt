.. appengine-pipelines documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the *Unofficial* docs for the **appengine-pipelines** package.
===========================================================================

This is just a personal project to have the **source docstrings** available
online.  The *real* project homepage is `github.com/googlecloudplatform/appengine-pipelines <https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/appengine-pipelines/>`_
and the the `wiki there has the user documentation <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-pipelines/wiki>`_.

The information here is the result of running Sphinx over a slightly
modified fork of the appengine-pipelines package to automatically extract
and format the docstrings.  If you find any problems with *this* documentation
the place to report it is `here at *this* fork on github <https://github.com/formans/appengine-pipelines>`_.
